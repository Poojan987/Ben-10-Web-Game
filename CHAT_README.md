Chat summary — Ben-10-Web-Game repository audit

What I did
- Scanned the repository files and searched HTML/CSS/JS for filename references.
- Identified files and folders that appear not to be referenced by the runtime (likely unused).

Key findings (high level)
- Files that are clearly used: `Files/index.html`, `Files/ben.js`, `Files/ben.css`, `Files/Diamon.css`, `Files/Hybrid.css`, `Files/prePostScreen.css` and their referenced images (e.g., `BenLatest.png`, `DHfinal1.png`, `HybridFinal3.png`, `diamonds.png`, `key_z.png`, `key_x.png`).
- Likely-unused candidates (no references found in code):
  - `Files/Temp/` (whole folder; temporary/copies of assets)
  - `Files/backup/` (backup copies of pages/CSS/JS)
  - ZIP archives: `Files/Project.zip`, `Files/LatestZip.zip`, `Files/index1.zip`, `Files/DiamondHead.zip`, `Files/ben10.zip`
  - Authoring/source images: `*.xcf` files such as `Files/Template.xcf`, `Files/Diamond1.xcf`, `Files/Diamond.xcf`, `Files/Temp/*.xcf`

Assumptions and caveats
- "Unused" here means not referenced by HTML/CSS/JS in the repo. It does NOT mean the files are definitely safe to delete — they may be useful backups, designer sources, or referenced outside the repo.
- I did not perform runtime discovery (e.g., network requests or server-side code). I relied on text search of repository files.

Recommended next steps
1. Archive: Move `Files/Temp/`, `Files/backup/`, and `.zip` files into a new `Files/archive/` folder (or zip them) so they're preserved but out of the main tree.
2. Verify: Open `Files/index.html` locally (before and after moving) to confirm there are no missing assets.
3. Clean up: After verification, delete archived items from the main branch or keep `Files/archive/` but add a `README` explaining contents.

If you'd like me to proceed, I can: create `Files/archive/` and move the candidates there, or produce a full path list for manual review, or add a small PowerShell audit script to re-run this check.

Safe to remove without thinking (conservative)
The following files/folders are backup/temp/project archives or designer source files that the web app does not reference. These are safe to remove from the tracked repo if you don't need design sources or backups. I recommend archiving them first if unsure.

- `Files/backup/` (entire folder)
- `Files/Temp/` (entire folder)
- `Files/Project.zip`
- `Files/LatestZip.zip`
- `Files/index1.zip`
- `Files/DiamondHead.zip`
- `Files/ben10.zip`
- `Files/template.xcf`
- `Files/Diamond1.xcf`
- `Files/Diamond.xcf`

If you want, I can archive these into `Files/archive/` now (move them there and commit the change). If you prefer a dry-run, I can also produce a PowerShell command you can run locally to move them yourself.
